* @brief Retrieves derivation key for sfs secret key. key_len value shall not less than 16,

* If key_len value exceeds 32, qsee will only take first 32 bytes as the sfs kdf derivation key.
*
* @details When not using the OEM key, sfs secret key will be different depending on whether the JTAG_DISABLE eFuse is blown.
* Before the fuse is blown, sfs kdf uses the dummy HW derived key as the kdf derivation key.
* After the fuse is blown, sfs kdf uses the HW derived key as kdf derivation key.
*
* If key is set by OEM, sfs kdf always uses OEM key as kdf derivation key to create sfs secret key,
* and JTAG_DISABLE eFuse won't affect the sfs secret key value.

* @brief Controls SFS file segment size

* @details SFS creates several sub-files of equal size (file segments, or simply segments for short)
*  which are then encrypted and integrity-protected before being written to the underlying file system.
*  This function let the OEM decide the segment size.
*  For example, OEM have 2000 bytes plain text to save to SFS. The default SFS segment size is 1024 byte,
*  so SFS creates 2 segments (1024 bytes, 976 bytes + 48 bytes padding) on HLOS file system.
*  If OEM change the segment size to 2048 bytes, SFS creates 1 segment (2000 bytes + 48 bytes padding) on
*  HLOS file system.
*
*  OEM should be very cautious to make the change of segment size.
*
*@return segment size
*@side effect: After the segment size change, The SFS files saved with old segment are useless.
* Must clean up the old SFS files on HLOS file system manually.

*  This function let OEM to set root folder other than /persist/data/
*  For example, if OEM set root path to /OEM/subfolder/
*  SFS and TZ counter files will be generated under /OEM/subfolder/sfs/ and
*  /OEM/subfolder/tz/
*  The path must start with '/' and end with '/', path length < 128 bytes
