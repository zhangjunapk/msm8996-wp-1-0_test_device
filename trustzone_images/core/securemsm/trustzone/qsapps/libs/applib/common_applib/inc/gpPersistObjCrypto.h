/*===========================================================================
===
=== The gpPersistObjCrypto module provides an interface between the
=== cryptographic resources needed by the PersistentObject implementation
=== and the low level cryptographic services provided by the Trustzone
=== crypto driver.
===
=== This module provides the following protection and verification of the
=== below security features:
===     - Confidentiality (AES256 CBC)
===     - Integrity       (HMAC SHA256, HASH SHA256)
=== through the interface defined in this file.
===
=== Version 1.0
===   As part of version 1.0, there are some restrictions on the usage of
===   these APIs.
===     1. The IV and HMAC/HASH sizes currently only support usage with
===        AES256 and SHA256 algorithms. Use the macro definitions below to
===        guarentee that you are allocating the correc sizes.
===     2. The only valid value of 'handle' in each of the APIs provided below
===        is NULL. This parameter will be used for further expansion and
===        GP use cases.

=== gpCrypto_Encrypt
===
=== Encrypt data specified using iv provided by the caller and unique key
=== generated internally for application. Encryption operation will be done
=== in place within the user allocated buffer provided.
===
=== Parameters:
===   - [in]handle    Used by GP Persistent Object Framework to specify meta
===                   data for additional functionality. Pass NULL for non-GP
===                   use cases.
===   - [in/out]data  Pointer to buffer containing data to encrypt, which will
===                   also contain the output ciphertext after encryption. Caller
===                   is responsible for memory management of buffer.
===   - [in]dataLen   Length of the data buffer allocated by caller.
===   - [out]iv       Pointer to the iv (initialization vector) container in
===                   which a random value will be generated.
===   - [in]ivLen     Length of the iv buffer allocated by the caller.
===
=== Returns
===   - TEE_SUCCESS        When encrypt operation is successfull.
===   - TEE_ERROR_GENERIC  When encrypt operation fails.

=== gpCrypto_Protect
===
=== Protect the data specified by generating a hash and/or hmac into the
=== specified containers.
===
=== Parameters:
===   - [in]handle    Used by GP Persistent Object Framework to specify meta
===                   data for additional functionality. Pass NULL for non-GP

===   - [in]dataLen   Length of the data buffer allocated by caller.
===   - [out]hash     Pointer to the hash output container where the generated
===                   hash over the data will be stored. Caller is responsible
===                   for memory management of buffer.
===   - [in]hashLen   Length of the hash container allocated by the caller.

===   - [in]hmacLen   Length of the hmac container allocated by the caller.
===
=== Returns
