/*===========================================================================
===
=== The gpPersistObjFileIO module provides an interface for persistent storage
=== of transparent data. This transparent data is stored in the HLOS virtual
=== file system, so its the responsibility of the caller to provide the 
=== necessary security on top of the transparent data. Data is transferred to
=== an HLOS listener which interacts directly with the virtual file system,
=== and because there is overhead in the transfer of data between secure and 
=== non-secure context it is advised to reduce the amount of calls to these
=== APIs by increasing data sizes.
===
=== Version 1.0
===   As part of version 1.0, there are some restrictions on the usage of 
===   these APIs. 
===     1. Files should ONLY be written in one-shot, meaning the write call
===        should be made with a buf equal to the size of the file. This will
===        guarantee power cycle protection provided by the virtual file
===        system.
===     2. As a consequence of restriction 1. the offset provided to a write
===        should also be 0, and this is the only acceptable input for version 
===        1.0.
===     3. The only valid value of handle in each of the APIs provided below
===        is NULL. This parameter will be used for further expansion and
===        GP use cases.

=== gpFileIO_Read_File
===
=== Read data from the specified file.
===
=== Parameters:
===   - [in]handle    Used by GP Persistent Object Framework to specify meta
===                   data for additional functionality. Pass NULL for non-GP
===                   use cases.
===   - [in]name      File name which is used to identify the file in the virtual
===                   file system.
===   - [out]buffer   Buffer in which the file data will be copied to. Caller is 
===                   responsible for memory management of buffer.
===   - [in]size      Size of buffer which was allocated from the caller.
===   - [in]offset    The offset in the file to start reading size bytes from.
===   - [out]count    Returns the number of bytes actually read.
===
=== Returns
===   - TEE_SUCCESS         On successful read operation.
===   - TEE_ERROR_GENERIC   On failure of read operation.
